                You know there are certain things which become sooooo popular that
                there isn’t a right or wrong way of doing it anymore? Chicken Tikka is
                one of those things. Although I have a huge disagreement with the
                people who make chicken tikka masala in the west (it DOESNT HAVE CREAM
                PEOPLE!) but that’s a debate for some other day.

                So Chicken Tikka is one of those extremely popular South Asian
                cuisines that have made a place all around the world. And unless
                you’ve been living on deserted Island, I bet you’ve definitely tried
                Tikka atleast ONCE. Just like Biryani, Burgers and Omelettes, this one
                has a million different versions on the internet. And I am about to
                share one more.
